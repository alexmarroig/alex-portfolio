      <p>
        ETHOS is an offline-first clinical platform designed to support psychologists working with highly sensitive data.
        The product balances privacy, ethics, usability, and applied AI in environments where trust and human judgment are non-negotiable.
      </p>

      <h2 style={{ fontSize: 18, marginTop: 22 }}>Problem</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Fragmented tools increase cognitive load and reduce consistency.</li>
        <li>Cloud-first solutions raise privacy, compliance, and trust concerns.</li>
        <li>Documentation is time-consuming and often misaligned with real clinical workflows.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 style={{ fontSize: 18, marginTop: 22 }}>Solution</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Offline-first by default</strong> with explicit control over sync and cloud usage.</li>
        <li><strong>Privacy by design</strong> and local data ownership.</li>
        <li><strong>Assistive AI</strong> (transcription, organization, note structuring) with transparency and human review.</li>
        <li><strong>Workflow-centered UX</strong> built for real clinical contexts.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 style={{ fontSize: 18, marginTop: 22 }}>My Role</h2>
      <p>
        I designed, built, and delivered ETHOS end-to-end — product discovery, UX, architecture, implementation,
        applied AI boundaries, automation, and system logic.
      </p>

      <h2 style={{ fontSize: 18, marginTop: 22 }}>Key Decisions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Local-first AI workflows to reduce ethical and compliance risk.</li>
        <li>Intentional UX friction where professional judgment must remain explicit.</li>
        <li>Flexible documentation models aligned with real clinical practice.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 style={{ fontSize: 18, marginTop: 22 }}>Note</h2>
      <p style={{ opacity: 0.85 }}>
        This is a private product case. Additional implementation details are available upon request.
